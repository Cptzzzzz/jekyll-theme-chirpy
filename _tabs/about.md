I am an undergraduate student majoring in software engineering at BUAA, with a strong interest in distributed systems and cloud computing. 

Hereâ€™s my blog on which I share what I have learned recently. Updates may or may not come regularly.

My blog is roughly divided into course notes, reading notes, some learning experiences on new technologies, and some other miscellaneous items. The content I have written only represents my personal understanding, so it is inevitable that there will be some errors. If you discover these contents, you are very welcome to discuss them together in the comments section.

>For any consequence caused by the use of my blog content, I will not bear any legal responsibilities.
